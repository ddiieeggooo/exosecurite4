ForceFeeding Attack
here you have a personnal account in the Bankprblematique.sol contract that allows whitdrawal only if the balance is strictly equal to 10 eth, so the Attack smart contract will send eth to Bankprblematique.sol until it exceeds 10 eth, then it will trigger the attack through the self destruct function that can empty a smart contract and send the balance to a given addr. To solve this (BankFixed), you have to modify the require in the withdrawAll function to set the amount of required balance to >= 10eth and not strictly == 10 eth.
